## Area Service
The Wheeling Area Service Committee of Narcotics Anonymous meets at 12:30 PM on the 4th Sunday of every Month. (If the 4th Sunday falls on a Holiday we will meet on the 3rd Sunday of the Month)

Youth Services System Inc. 4th Floor, Room 401 87 15th and Jacob Street Wheeling, West Virginia [Map and Directions](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=87+15th+Street,+Wheeling,+WV&hl=en&sll=40.365277,-82.669252&sspn=6.946801,15.150146&oq=87+15th+Street&hnear=87+15th+St,+Wheeling,+West+Virginia+26003&t=m&z=17)

If you want to give back and be of service to Narcotics Anonymous, any member can attend. If there are not open service positions immediately, there soon will be in the spirit of rotation. Just come to the next Area Service meeting.

Planning, set-up, and clean-up for area events is a great way to be part of, and to give back... they are not a service provided to us, they are what we do. Area events, and events put on by groups in the area, can be found on the event calendar. If you want to be part of making it happen, come to sub-committee meetings.
